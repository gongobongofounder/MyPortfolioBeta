<h3>Mathematical Background</h3>
<p>I am Atrajit, a passionate mathematician and software developer, having completed my <strong>MSc in Mathematics from IIT Delhi</strong>. My primary academic interests lie in <strong>analysis, number theory, and algebra</strong>, and I am actively preparing for <strong>PhD admissions in August 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>I have completed a project on Morse theory under the supervision of Dr. Biplab Basak. You can find my project in my first blog.</p>
<br>
<h3>Technical and Coding Background</h3>
<p>Beyond mathematics, I have a deep passion for programming and technology. I specialize in <strong>Jetpack Compose for Android development</strong>, with hands-on experience in <strong>chat applications, GitHub-integrated content fetching, and local database management using Hilt</strong>. Additionally, I have a strong command over <strong>C++</strong>, where I teach students and explore areas like <strong>3D simulation</strong>. My programming expertise also extends to <strong>Python automation</strong>, including <strong>WhatsApp auto-replies, PDF conversions, and file handling</strong>.</p>
